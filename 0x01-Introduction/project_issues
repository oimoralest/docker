Problems that I had developing this project

Now I am trying macOS Big Sur installed through OpenCore (https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/).

Since I do not have an Intel CPU with virtualization capabilities and hypervisor support (I am using Ryzen 5 2600),
I had to install to install docker machine through virtual box:
(https://medium.com/crowdbotics/a-complete-one-by-one-guide-to-install-docker-on-your-mac-os-using-homebrew-e818eb4cfc3)

For short, you need to install brew and run the following commands:
- brew install docker docker-machine
- brew cask install virtualbox or brew --cask install virtualbox
- docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default
- docker-machine env default
- eval "$(docker-machine env default)"

Each time I restart my macOS, I run the following commands to run docker:
- docker-machine start default
- docker-machine env default
- eval "$(docker-machine env default)"

On windows I did not have any problem yet
