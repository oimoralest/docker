- While I was trying to push an image I got the error Error saving credentials:
  error storing credentials - err: exec: "docker-credential-desktop":
  executable file not found in $PATH, out: ``.

  I solved this error editing the ~/.docker/config.json file and changing the
  credsStore attribute.
